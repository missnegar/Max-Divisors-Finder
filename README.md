# Max-Divisors-Finder 
  *** Exercise to learn Python is to use functions
  This Python script reads 20 numbers from the user input and finds the number with the maximum number of divisors. It then prints the number along with the count of its divisors

#Usage
  Clone the repository to your local machine:
  ``` git clone https://github.com/missnegar/Max-Divisors-Finder ```
  Navigate to the project directory:
  ```cd max-divisors-finder ```
  Run the Python script:
  ```python biggest-divi.py ```
  Enter 20 numbers when prompted.

#How it Works
  The find_max_divisors function iterates through the list of numbers and calculates the number of divisors for each number using the count_divisors function. It keeps track of the   number with the maximum divisors and its count.

  The count_divisors function calculates the number of divisors for a given number.

#Example
  ```
  Enter number 1: 12
  Enter number 2: 20
  Enter number 3: 8
  ...
  Enter number 20: 15
  The number with the most divisors is: 12
  It has 6 divisors.
  ```
